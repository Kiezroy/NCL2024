- Go to the developer tools and look at the Network tab
- We can see that when we add an item, a certain payload is created
- Exploit that payload with the ```{content: "Banana"}```
  
- Copy the cURL

- Edit the payload to look simlar to this (IMPORTANT: make the content at the end 100):
- Making it 1000 increases the buffer size to display the entire flag
- Paste the cURL command into a bash terminal (I used WSL)
